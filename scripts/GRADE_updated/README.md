# RUNNING GRADE WITH ADDED RINGS

In the current setup the following command should work 
./GRADE -i single_frame.gro -o single_frame.gro -f4 YES

## Description
GRADE analyzes atomic positions of oxygen atoms of water to compute the number of $5^{12}$, $6^{2}5^{12}$, and $6^{4}5^{12}$ cages and account for their three-dimensional structures. The latter can be used for visualization using software such as VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics). GRADE stands for "cages" in Portuguese. *`F4`* order parameter can also be calculated for trajectories.

To understand how the code works and for examples of the output files, please refer to the published paper.

# Using Docker to run the code (recommended)

You can use the docker image of this code to skip compiling the c++ source code by first pulling the docker image from `Dockerhub` and then run the code using the docker image. You can follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

2. Pull Grade's docker image from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/farbodnobar/grade/general):
```.sh
docker pull farbodnobar/grade:v1.0
```
3. Go to the directory where you store your input .gro files:
```
cd ~/YOUR_WORKING_DIR/
```
4. Find the `IMAGE ID` corresponding to Grade's docker image:
```
image_id=$(docker images -q farbodnobar/grade:v1.0)
```
5. Execute Grade through the docker image:
```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data -w /data $image_id grade -i test.gro 
```
The last command runs a Docker container using Grade's docker image, attaches it to your current working directory, and sets the container's working directory to `/data`. It runs the Grade code and after completion of the command, removes the container on exit. The output files of Grade will be written in your current working directory. 

# Compiling from source code
GRADE is written in C++ and is made up of a main program file [GRADE.cpp](./GRADE.cpp) and two supporting resource files [MyFunctions.hpp](./MyFunctions.hpp) and [MyFunctions.cpp](./MyFunctions.cpp). Use the provided [Makefile](./Makefile) to compile GRADE by typing:



## Prerequisites:
GNU Compiler Collection  version 6.1.0 or newer.



## Compilation:

GRADE is written in C++ and is made up of a main program file (GRADE.cpp) and two supporting resource files (MyFunctions.hpp and MyFunctions.cpp). Clone the repo and change directory to `./PATH_TO_GRADE/GRADE/`. Use the Makefile to compile GRADE by typing: 

```.sh
$ make
$ make clean
```

## Usage: 

If the gro file containing atomic positions of water molecules is named “test.gro”, to run the code with all default values: 

```.sh
$ ./GRADE -i test.gro 
```

This will generate following files by default (if at least one cage is found in test.gro): test.xvg, test_cage512-frame.gro, test_cage62512-frame.gro (if 62512 cages exist).

A separate gro file is generated for each time-frame of the test.gro.

## Notes:
- Grade is optimized to work with .gro files written by GROMACS. Trajectories converted from other MD packages may encounter issues with reading the data. 
- Currently, Grade recognizes 4-atom water models.
